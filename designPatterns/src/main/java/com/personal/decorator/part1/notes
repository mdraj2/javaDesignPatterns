This pattern will help you decorate an object at run time instead of compile time
This pattern encourages object composition instead of inheritence.

One advantage of this pattern is that you will be able to change or give new 
responsibilities of a class without changing the underlying class itself

In here we show what you should not do.

Lets say in this folder we have more than decaf which is the base case. We also have decaf with 
whipped cream and chocolate and we do this for every class. This would be a massive pain.
The questions then becomes how do we solve this sort of issue.

We are not favouring composition over inheritence and we are not encapsulating what is changing
