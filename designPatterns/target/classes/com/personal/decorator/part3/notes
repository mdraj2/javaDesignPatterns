but remember that you should not introduce behaviours that are not part of the main interface
in the decorators. This could lead to issues with type down the line if you are not careful.
But this was not stated explicitly in the books, so verify if this is correct. Also note that
with decorator pattern it is almost like recursion and you can change the values as the as you 
pass in the input.
