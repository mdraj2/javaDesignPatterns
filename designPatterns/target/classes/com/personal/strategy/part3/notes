In this part we will find the parts that are changing and then extract them out.
Take what varies and encapsulate them so that it wont affect the rest of your code 

Ideally what should happen is that you make a new package with the behaviours. The
behaviours will implement an interface("the term is defined differently in the book").
Now in the Duck class you will make instances variables with the types of those interfaces.
Now when you extend the duck class the member variables will also be inherited by those 
instances. So in the constructor of the subclass all we need to do is to set the 
memeber variable.
