This pattern is about loosening the couping.

In an interface it's a class who is publicly accessible methods and variables. The author says that Duck duck = new MallardDuck()
is coding to an implementation. Is this because that Duck itself is a concrete implementation?

Anyways, looking at page113 of head first we are violating the open close principle because we need to change it when
we are adding or removing orders.
